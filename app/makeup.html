          On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of
          the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those
          who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly
          simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what
          we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the
          obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always
          holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to
          avoid worse pains.

                Beautiful makeup is the key to self-confidence, so it is doubly important for a photo shoot. The camera never captures color exactly as we
                see it in real life. Therefore, the makeup for the photo shoot should be a little more intense than that which is done in everyday life.
                Even if you want your face to look as natural as possible in the photo, you still need to exaggerate the makeup you put on, because it won't
                show through the camera as much.

                The main difference between makeup for a photo shoot and normal makeup is that only matte foundation should be used for the photo. Also in
                the makeup should be drawn clear lines and carefully shaded shadows, tone and blush.
